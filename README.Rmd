Here is my data analysis of the power posing paper by Carney, Cuddy and Yap 2010:

	@article{carney2010power,
  		title={Power posing brief nonverbal displays affect neuroendocrine levels and risk tolerance},
	    author={Carney, Dana R and Cuddy, Amy JC and Yap, Andy J},
  		journal={Psychological Science},
  		volume={21},
  		number={10},
  		pages={1363--1368},
  		year={2010},
  		publisher={Sage Publications}
		}

Some background:

	- Cuddy gave a Ted talk which had 35 million views (two of these 35m are from me), in which she argued that a two minute power pose, basically \o/, will give you enough of a testosterone boost to boost your performance, e.g., in job interviews.
    - Andrew Gelman roundly criticized her claims. Low power, poor statistical inference, weak results, many potential confounds including measurement error.
    - Carney recently wrote a note on her home page rejecting the results of this paper.
    - Cuddy still believes that the power pose works.

I was interested in seeing how well the results hold up. In a recent interview, Cuddy said that she had given her data to a statistician, and he confirmed her results. I took the cleaned data that the statistican provides, and reanalyze the data to see if I can recover the claimed effects.
